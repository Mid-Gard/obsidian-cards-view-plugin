# Contribution guidelines

You use this plugin and want to contribute ? First off, thank you for considering contributing to Cards View.

Cards View have been increasing in popularity since its first release, and I am very happy to see that people are using it. I am also very happy
to see that people are contributing to it. I am always looking for ways to improve the plugin and make it more useful.

However, maintaining a plugin like this takes time and effort. I want this plugin to mature, but also to 
stay stable and viable. For this reason, I will be very careful in accepting contributions that I can maintain
and that are in line with the vision I have for the plugin.

## Bugfixes

All bug fixes are welcome. Be aware that because Cards View should be able to handle thousands of files, performance
is often a key issue. Sometimes, you might be tempted to reimplement a feature in a more simple way in order
to fix a bug, but it might be the case that they are implemented the way they are for the sake of performance.
Of course, contributions that improve performance are always welcome.

## Features

If you want to add a feature, please open an issue first to discuss it. This is to avoid wasting time on a feature that
might not be accepted.
